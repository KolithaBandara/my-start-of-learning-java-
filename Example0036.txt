--------------------------------------1. Local Variables-----------------------------------------

1. Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks.

2. Local variables are created when the method, constructor or block is entered and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the method, constructor, or block.

3. Access modifiers cannot be used for local variables.

4. Local variables are visible only within the declared method, constructor, or block.

5. Local variables are implemented at stack level internally.

6. There is no default value for local variables, so local variables should be declared and an initial value should be assigned before the first use.
