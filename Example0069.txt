--------------------------------------Getting Keyboard Input----------------------------------------

To get keyboard input in Java, you can use the Scanner class from the java.util package.
The Scanner class provides methods for reading input from the keyboard and parsing it into different data types (such as int, double, etc.).

Here is an example of how you can use the Scanner class to get keyboard input in Java:

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
int num = input.nextInt();
System.out.println("You entered: " + num);


In this example, the Scanner class is used to read an integer from the keyboard. 
The nextInt() method reads the next token of input as an int and returns it.

You can also use the nextLine() method to read a whole line of input as a string.

For example:

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter a line of text: ");
String line = input.nextLine();
System.out.println("You entered: " + line);

This code reads a whole line of text from the keyboard and stores it in the line variable.

Keep in mind that the Scanner class reads input in a blocking manner, which means that the program will wait for the user to enter input before continuing.
