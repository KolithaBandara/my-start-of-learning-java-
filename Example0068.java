//String is not a primitive data type, is an Object, Class

/*
The string data type is a non-primitive data type but it is predefined in java,
some people also call it a special ninth primitive data type.
This solves the case where a char cannot store multiple characters, 
a string data type is used to store the sequence of characters.
